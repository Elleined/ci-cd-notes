Notes for CI/ CD

# What is CI/ CD?
- One of the Approach of SDLC.

## CI (Continuous Integration)
- That means instead of deploying your code at the end of day, week or anytime you want you will deploy it the moment you commit and push it in your remote repository.
- CI includes the build, test, and merge process of your project.

## CD (Continuous Delivery)
- That means making your source code ready to be released in production/ live environment. Also having a specific version of your project ready to be delivered in your client or to your co-workers or deployed in different environments(To be discussed later).
